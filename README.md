# lab-02-301

This lab is a test on how we can get a json object from data folder using ajax method, and how to minipulate the dom to show this data.

The data will return as a Array of Json objects.

The data is contained in data folder, `page-1.json` as a json file.

If you click in this [Link](https://sayefdeen.github.io/lab-02-301/index.html) you will see the page, you can sort the result with two options, and you can filter them according to a specific keyword that was already stored in the `page-1.json` file
